# Codeforces Companion (Coco)

Developed at PennApps XVIII (2018 Fall), Codeforces Companion (Coco) is a Chrome Extension that suggests programming problems near your skill level based on similarly categorized problems that you have solved in the past. Coco applies a mathematical model that we developed using binary search to determine problem difficulties and user skill based on real-life submission data gathered using the Codeforces API.
